# Notes on Driscoll

Nepos' "On Kings" is at the end of a series of accounts of Greek generals. [You can list them.] Missing from this list are some of the most famous ones… Philip, Alexander, etc.

This essay is N's way of explaining why these guys are missing. 'Cause he wrote another book "On Kings", and they get full bios there. **But** he does say a few things about them.


- Who or what are the "Duadochi"? And is it "Duadochi" or "Diadochi"?
- In the big section: Start this off with some language that lets the reader know that you are about to summarize what N. says about kings and generals. Then you don't need to keep mentioning it.
- Begin "the big section" with something like: "Briefly, Nepos says the following about kings who were also active generals…"
- In the big section, some paragraphs:
  - Initial one about kings
  - Philip
  - Alexander
  - …
-
