# Nepos essay "Of Kings"

##Introduction

This is an introduction to "Of Kings" written by Cornelius Nepos from his collection of essays The Lives of Eminent Commanders.  This is a piece of work originally written in Ancient Greek in the Second Century BCE. The translation I worked with was translated by Rev. John Selby Watson in 1876.[^Watson] The text of Watson's translation was published on the world-wide-web in  in 2003.[^Online] I am publishing this citable digital edition under an open license, with documentation.

##Nepos

Cornelius Nepos was born in c. 110 BCE and died in c. 24 BCE.[^Britannica]  He was born in Northern Italy (Cisalpine Gual) just like Latin poet Gaius Valerius Catullus.  From the dates of his life it is shown that he lived for 86 years.  Cornelius Nepos was one of the earliest biographers to write in Latin.  Even though Latin today is a dead language.  He was also considered a Roman historian in his time.  In his writings he did biographies on many distinguished Romans as well as many foreigners.  Some of these biographies include Cato as well as Cicero.[^Britannica]  Nepos looked to write simply but without elegance or purity.  In his writing he tried to write ethical lessons and uncritically praised his subjects.

##Of Kings

What separates a king from a general?  A king has higher position then a general and most generals will never make it to the king position.  Some kings are kings by name but not in power like Ageslaus the Lacdaemonian.  The king usually rules by birthright.  This means that the being a king is passed down through lineage.  The thing that separates a general from a king is the actions the king does in everyday life as well as how he leads on the battle field.  The two kings that excelled more than the rest are Philip and Alexander the Great.  Philip was the father of Alexander the Great.  He was a member of the Macedonian kings and was the founder of the unified Macedonian state.  Philip was assassinated by one of his seven body guards and the rumor was he was killed because his wife Cleopatra offended the body guard.  He died in 336 BC.  Alexander the Great the 3rd is another important king.  Alexander comes from the nation of Macedonians.  Alexander as a King set out to invade India and, in the process, defeated them.  After the win Alexander became sick with an unknown disease and his life was taken from him.  He died in 323 BC.  Alexander the Great dies 13 years after his father Philip.  Following the death of Alexander, the Great two important generals rose to power.  These were Antignous and Seleucus Nicator.  Antignous name in Greek means worthy and comparable of his father.  His father was Philip.  His brother was Alexander the Great.  Following Alexander, the Greats death in the war of the Duadochi Philip was said to have a major role in that war.  Then in 306BC he was declared a king.  Seleucus was appointed the commander of the companions.  When Alexander the Great was ruling Seleucus was appointed the infantry general and was later established as the empire of Seleucid Empire.  The death of Seleucus Nicator is not very well known but it is said he was assassinated and betrayed in a conspiracy.  Throughout this reading the idea shown is that kings’ actions are shown separately and that the reading is for almost all the generals of Greece.  

##Conclusion
Nepos' essay "Of Kings" does not focus on a single commander but on the category of "Greek generals".  These generals were also looked at as kings. Spartan kings were looked at as very powerful and influentially people.  Cornelius Nepos lead as a leader and is now looked to be very influential in Roman society.
