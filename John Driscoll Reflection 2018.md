In my first year writing seminar also called "FYW" the class was based around the idea of digital reading and digital writing. The main idea in this course was being able to find literature online and converting it to a document where you could perform an in-depth analyst on it. Throughout this course, I learned many skills that will allow me to become a better candidate when being considered for a job and also skills to keep up with the fast past of technology.

Some of the skills I learned were patience, learning how to use Atom and the terminal and lastly how to read a document that doesn't make sense at first but learning how to understand it. These skills allowed me to become successful in this class and will lead to more success in the future.

The skill of patience was tested throughout this class but ultimately, in the end, I was able to master it. Many people struggle with patience because of how fast pace our society is and how no one has time to wait. My patience was tested straight from day one of the course when I was told I was going to be using my laptop a lot. I am not a fan of technology because of the struggles it brings and how it takes time to understand and learn how to use the computer. These struggles that came with this class allowed me to practice patience and in the end be able to produce a work of literature that I was proud of. In this course, I chose "Of Kings" which is an excerpt from Cornelius Nepos Lives of Eminent Commanders. I worked weeks and weeks on breaking down this writing in Atom and terminal so I could understand what was being said and write my perspective on it. My class as a whole will pull all of our writings together to then post online for a summary of our readings. The breaking down part and learning how to write code to help me fully understand this document took weeks to learn. While doing this we had to type things in accurately as well as wait minutes for the computers virtual machine to load up. The waiting and the precision is where I learned to just slow down and become patience while things worked to load up and complete.

For me, I never knew all the powers my little laptop had until I started to use the applications terminal and Atom. These applications we what allowed us to more fully understand our text be dividing them into smaller sentences, allowing us to count the individual words and use this information to understand what Cornelius Nepos was truly talking about. Learning how to use these application is something that will help me in the future because of the technology that is advancing in the world. As I look to the future and plan on applying for jobs knowing these applications will give me an advantage over other candidates. After the learning curve I was able to use them in other classes to help me complete assignments as well as use them to my advantage and have to do less work. Learning how to function Atom and the terminal will continue to make me more efficient in my school work and has given me another skill to continue to develop.

In life reading was never something I enjoyed, reading to me was a hassle and in my mind a waste of time. I would rather be outside playing or hanging out watching tv. Sadly because of these habits reading today still is a challenge and takes more time for me to comprehend something compared to others. The idea of taking longer to comprehend literature goes right along with the document we read in this class. When I first read "Of Kings" by Cornelius Nepos I was baffled by how dense the reading was and had a tough time understanding exactly what was being said. Although it was tough I was seeking to understand exactly what was being said. To do this, I had to do something I have never done before. I had to do research about a reading passage that was supposed to be the research I needed. This research took time and effort but allowed me to begin to fully understand “Of Kings”. While doing this research my patience was once again tested but more importantly, I learned how to dive deep down into my research to find adequate facts to help me understand this challenging document. When I was able to understand what I was reading and had a general idea of what was happening the document finally began to make sense and I could comprehend what was being said. This made me feel as I had completed a challenge that was set before me and I was able to master it. The most important aspect of this challenge was I found out more about myself and what I need to do to become successful and how I can accomplish anything I put my mind too.

As cheesy as that sounds this course and the work allowed me to learn many important things about myself before tackling the rest of my college career. This biggest lesson I learned was that because of my dyslexia that doesn't stop me from doing anything that other people can do. Through "Of Kings" by Cornelious Nepos I learned about Alexander the Great as well as I learned about myself in the process which is amazing that the same document can do that.
